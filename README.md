# Product Management Story Breakdowns

Welcome to my 14-day product management deep dive, where I analyze products using storytelling, emotional impact, and PM thinking.

## What’s inside?

Each markdown file breaks down a product's user journey using the **3-act story framework**:
- Act 1: The Problem (Hook)
- Act 2: The Solution (Journey)
- Act 3: The Success (Emotional Payoff)
- Director’s Reflection: My PM insights on improving the experience

## Why this matters

This is my daily workout to become dangerously good at product management by focusing on user emotions, flows, and product improvement.

## How to use

- Browse each day’s file to see detailed product breakdowns.
- Feel free to reach out with feedback or questions!
